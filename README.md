# **SMART POST**
## **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
When a new postman joins a new post office, it will take him a lot of time to understand the location of all the houses and the corresponding addresses. This may lead to the delay in delivering the posts. Also when the postman arrives at a house to deliver the post, the house owner may not be present in the house, which may lead to delay in delivering the post as well as wastage of both resources and time of the postal department which decreases the efficiency of the post man. The delay of the delivery of post may adversely affect the life of the receiver because the post may contain some important document or some important informations to the receiver. <br />The solution provided here makes  the services provided by the postal department more convenient to the general public as well as reduces the  effort of the staffs of the postal department. This solution is in line with the theme provided which is the Digitisation to ease access to social services.
## **USE CASES:**

*   The main targeted users of the smart post is the staff of the postal department. The addresses are linked to the location and directions to the destination. The time slot allows the receiver to be ready on time to accept the post.
*   There are several other use cases for this particular application. The service it provides allows any emergency services like the ambulance, health care staffs and firefighters to arrive at the mentioned address without wasting time to find out the shortest path to the location.
