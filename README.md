# **SMART POST**
## **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
When a new postman joins a new post office, it will take him a lot of time to understand the location of all the houses and the corresponding addresses. This may lead to the delay in delivering the posts. Also when the postman arrives at a house to deliver the post, the house owner may not be present in the house, which may lead to delay in delivering the post as well as wastage of both resources and time of the postal department which decreases the efficiency of the post man. The delay of the delivery of post may adversely affect the life of the receiver because the post may contain some important document or some important informations to the receiver. <br />The solution provided here makes  the services provided by the postal department more convenient to the general public as well as reduces the  effort of the staffs of the postal department. This solution is in line with the theme provided which is the Digitisation to ease access to social services.
